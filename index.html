        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi. My name is Celina Lee and I am currently majoring in Pre-Business in the University of California of Riverside with a concentration in accounting. I graduated from Etiwanda High school in May 2019. I aspire to become a future Accountant who works at either one of the Big 4 accounting firms such as Deloitte, Price water house, Ernest & Young, and KPMG. I fell in love with accounting because accounting is needed in every company. It is an essential role that is necessary and critical to make the company function. It is a job that has growth and demand no matter what.
When I was in high school, I did several activities to make myself well-rounded. I played piano since I was six and continued to play until now. I participated in several recitals and obtained my certificate of merit level advanced, the highest distinction for that certificate. In addition, I formally took ballet training lessons. Furthermore, I participated in volunteer clubs such as the National Honors Society, Key Club, and involved myself in other clubs as well such as the badminton club and the Chinese Culture Club. Lastly, I was a Link Crew Leader that helped freshman make that transition from middle school to high school. By being involved, this allowed me to have a holistic high school experience and added to my skill set that I can use in the future.
I was raised by a single mother. Due to that, I lived my entire life trying to help out my mother in any way I can in terms of financial support or doing chores in the house. By the time I was legal to work, I searched for a job. I am currently working as a Barista for Starbucks who craft beverages to customers. Although it is not relevant to my concentration, working in Starbucks honed other critical skills like working under pressure and the ability to work in a group that I will be able to apply to other future jobs. While I am making drinks, I am also counting inventory, replenishing the inventory, counting the money received and recording it. This gives me a small experience of whats itâ€™s like to be an accountant. In addition, his job gave me insight into what it takes to run a company after working it behind the scenes. It also gave me a deeper appreciation for the people who work in the customer service industry and improved my communication skills which will be beneficial when communicating to customers, co-workers, or bosses in the future.
 Overall, I am a fast learner and am eager to learn and absorb information to make sure the job is done well. I am efficient, easily coachable and very detailed-oriented. I love to work in groups and do projects together. Over the next few years, I am hoping to engage in an internship in a companies so that I can gain on the job experience which will give me the practical experience and a glimpse of whatâ€™s its like to work as an accountant. I can be contacted at clee535@ucr.edu.
